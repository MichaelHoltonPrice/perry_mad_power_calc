# Steps to generate the observed data (.obs files)
# ------------------------------------------------------
# 1. The file pembertonEtAl2013.MS5795.arp was generated by the python code
#    /perry_mad_power_calc/code

# ------------------------------------------------------
# 2. I created a new file called 488_BiakaPygmy.arp and copied over
#    the necessary contexts from pembertonEtAl2013.MS5795.ar (modified
#    appropriately to, e.g., change the number of samples (only 1).


# ------------------------------------------------------
# 3. I then calculated the summary statistics with the command below.
#    The command outputs all summary stats in the definition file
#    (ssdefs.txt) along with header information (i.e., names of the summary
#    statistics). "_all" is appended to the output file
#    (488_BiakaPygmy_all.obs) to emphasize that it contains more summary
#    statistics than are actually needed by ABC Toolbox.
#    See: http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/arlequin35/man/arlsumstat_readme.txt

arlsumstat.exe 488_BiakaPygmy.arp 488_BiakaPygmy_all.obs 0 1

# ------------------------------------------------------
# 4. I created a new file called 488_BiakaPygmy.obs that contains only the
#    summary statistics needed by ABC Toolbox (i.e., in the example file
#    exampleSTR.obs that is part of the ABC Toolbox documentation.


# ------------------------------------------------------
The following command runs the sampler:
ABCsampler 488_BiakaPygmy.input
