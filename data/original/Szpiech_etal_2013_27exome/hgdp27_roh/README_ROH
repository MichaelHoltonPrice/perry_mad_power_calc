FILE: *.roh
      These files are named by the population and HGDP individual ID (i.e. Biaka454.roh).  They contain ROH tract information in the following format:

      <Header>
      <chr>	<ROH start position>	<ROH end position>	<ROH length>
      ...

FILE: roh_boundaries_by_pop.txt
      This file contains ROH boundary information for partitioning ROH into A/B/C classes from Pemberton et al. (2012) in the following format:
      <Header>
      <population>	<region>	<A/B boundary>	<B/C boundary>
      ...
